### The tasks

The first task is to get the application working! 
We have introduced a couple of errors to the application code that will stop the application running properly. 
Using the tools available to you find and correct the problems. 

The second task is to fix the tests. Unit tests are very important in making sure your code works as you expect it to. They also provide documentation of expected behaviours. 

The third task is to add a unit test. Unit tests generally cover as much of the codebase as possible.
This codebase is not fully covered. Add a unit test where you can see code that isn't covered.
